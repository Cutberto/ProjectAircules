# ProjectAircules
NASA Space Apps 2020 Competition
Project Aircules consists of a suit with an incorporated modified smart ‘gas’ mask,
capable of, more than filter, de-synthesize hazmat particles from the inhaled air through a rechargeable UV photocatalytic filter. 
Our goal is to protect the user from potential harmful agents such as mold, bacteria and, specially, viruses. 
Its design also avoids the constant investment of changing the mask’s filters,
as the photocatalytic chamber is meant to last around a year¹. Using NASA technology², 
this piece of PPE is geared towards health professional heroes in close contact with sick people during this moment of adversity. 

This repository contains the main.cpp file for the sketch-prototype of the funcitonality of the masks.

Extract from code documentation: 
This code inlcudes a preview of the OOP codificaion structure of 
our proposal, by creating a class that will represent
each mask connected to the monitoring unit, and an specific
class called CPU for the monitoring unit
We also inlcuded a preview of the interface when using 
the monitoring device, showcasing the functions that the 
product includes.
